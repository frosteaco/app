            <hr>
            <div class="inside">Our product aims to create a more stress free lifestyle using an environmentally friendly, healthy and sustainable drink that will satisfy all of our customers needs and wants for a low cost. Studies from Harvard have shown that coffee reduces heart disease, liver cancers, parkinsons , and even depression. We will have a wide range of flavours that will have a theme that would match the season they are currently sold in, for example there would be a watermelon flavoured iced tea in the summer. Our drinks will have many healthy minerals such as calcium, potassium, and iron. </div>

            <hr>
            <div class="inside">Though our drink can be consumed by most people we are aiming at the older generation like older people and parents as it. There is a gap in the market, the older generation. For example, most drinks are targeted towards the younger generation, such as Starbucks mainly targeting college students and young adults, with some sales up to 60, but they are diminishing. This shows that there is a gap in the market for the older generation. We have different sizes for different ages

            <hr>
            <div class="inside">Our coffee and tea brand will include Less sugar, responsibly sourced beans and tea leaves, no artificial sweeteners/flavouring, we prioritise taste, affordable prices, we include healthier options to drink, recycled materials, and no chemicals in our drinks. Our bottles will be biodegradable and there will be recycling stations placed in accessible places in the public allowing for less pollution and in return we will be encouraging less littering and to recycle all plastics. All of our ingredients will be picked from environmentally sustainable farms which are picked out specifically for the environmental benefits. We focus on the flavours and environmental damages when creating our drink, we arenâ€™t focusing on the fast food archetype which values time over taste. In our drinks we aim for a healthy, tasty and enjoyable experience which suits all ages. We will achieve a healthy drink by having no added sugars but still retain the taste with healthy sugars such as honey and other syrups.</div>
